Like lead. Like peanut butter. 

Back again but this time, lexing and parsing is done with ANTLR4.

This is a programming language that tries to be extremely messed up and is designed to give the user a very sketchy feel when using it.
See in `sample/` folder for examples.

## Dependencies

Requires gradle for building and jdk 8.

## Build Instructions

Open the terminal and type in

```sh
./gradlew build
```

Then open the directory `build/distributions`.
The tar and zip files are the finished productions.
